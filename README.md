Playlist Planet - A CPSC 304 Project

Using PHP, MySQL, Apache, Xampp, and HTML/CSS, we are currently building an interface to interact with our database and provide functionality for a radio station to manage it's content and users.

To test our app, download the zip and place it in your htdocs folder in xampp..
Navigate to ../install.php to create and configure your myphpadmin database automatically.
Navigate to ../public/index.php to test out the app.

Download the zip from the "Frontend" branch to see the latest frontend development.
